\section{What’s the Big Deal?}

Why should anyone care if a formula always gives zero?

At first, it feels like a puzzle you'd find in a high school math class — a question about simplifying expressions. But hidden inside this question is a doorway to some of the deepest ideas in computer science.

\subsection*{A Simple Question, A Powerful Problem}

Checking whether a formula always gives zero is surprisingly tricky for computers — especially when the formula is large and complicated.

Sure, you can try plugging in random numbers. If the result is zero every time, maybe the formula is always zero. But how do you \textit{know for sure}? What if there's one set of values, out of billions, that gives something other than zero?

\subsection*{The Power of Randomness}

In practice, computers often test formulas like this by choosing random values. It works well most of the time. This gives us what's called a \textit{randomized algorithm}: one that uses random choices to get the answer quickly and correctly \textit{with high probability}.

But randomness isn't perfect. What if we want a guarantee — a way to check always, deterministically, with no room for doubt?

That leads to a huge question in computer science:

Can every randomized algorithm be replaced by a reliable, step-by-step (deterministic) algorithm?
